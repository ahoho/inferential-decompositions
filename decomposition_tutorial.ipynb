    "### Welcome! This notebook describes a method of generating inferential decompositions from text as introduced in our EMNLP 2023 paper: [Natural Language Decompositions of Implicit Content Enable Better Text Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14583.pdf)!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will guide you through the process step-by-step, and provide explanations and code snippets along the way. The method can be broken down into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample a small number of items from your dataset**: Here, we use a dataset of tweets posted by legislators during the 115, 116 and 117th US Congresses. \n",
    "2. **Craft Implicit and Explicit Propositions**: Refer to Appendix 2. of our paper for a description of the instructions used in the paper to craft exemplar poropotitions. We will use the same instructions to craft implicit and explicit propositions for our dataset.\n",
    "3. **Prompt an LLM with the crafted exemplars**: Here, we will use GPT3.5 Turbo for our experiments. \n",
    "4. **Validate**: Confirm that a random sample of the generated decompositions are _plausible_.\n",
    "5. **Downstream Usage**: Use the decompositions in the target task. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, run the first cell below to import the necessary packages and set up the environment. The helper functions and accompanying code are in `eval_mteb.py` and `generation_utils.py`. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note: \n",
    "We assume that your OPENAI_API_KEY is an environment variable. One way to set it is by running - `conda env config vars set OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key_here>` inside your conda environment. It can also be set manually in the config by setting  `config[\"llm\"][\"openai_api_key\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below was tested on a linux server, but should work on other hardware with alterations to pytorch versioning. \\[More additions coming soon!]"

    "We sampled the following tweets from the dataset to create our exemplar propositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. \"The #HonestAds Act will strengthen protections against foreign interference in our election. No more election ads paid for in rubles.\"\n",
    "2. \"Our nation is hurting.\\\\n\\\\nGeorge Floyd's death was horrific and justice must be served. A single act of violence at the hands of an officer is one too many. \\\\n\\\\nGeorge Floyd deserved better. All black Americans do. Indeed, all Americans do.\"\n",
    "3. \"Happy Wyoming Day! Today, our great Equality State celebrates 151 years of being the first to officially recognize women's inherent right to vote and to hold office. \"\n",
    "4. \"\\\"More apologies from Mark Zuckerberg won't fix Facebook. We need accountability and action \\\\u2013 not vague commitments to do better while continuing to profit off of users' personal data. \"\n",
    "5. \"Finding a permanent solution to #ProtectDreamers is as urgent a task as ever. President Trump created this crisis, and he should stop tanking bipartisan congressional efforts to solve it. We owe it to these kids to keep them in the only country they've ever known as home.\"\n",
    "6. \"Qualified immunity reform should have as its focus professionalizing police departments, institutionalizing best police practices when it comes to use of force, and protecting constitutional rights of American citizens.\"\n",
    "7. \"Survivors of the coronavirus show symptoms of ME/CFS, a debilitating and chronic illness that already impacts 2.5 million Americans. I am fighting to secure the funding needed to treat this disease and give patients the care they need.\n",
