    "### Welcome! This notebook describes a method of generating inferential decompositions from text as introduced in our EMNLP 2023 paper: [Natural Language Decompositions of Implicit Content Enable Better Text Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14583.pdf)!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will guide you through the process step-by-step, and provide explanations and code snippets along the way. The method can be broken down into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample a small number of items from your dataset**: Here, we use a dataset of tweets posted by legislators during the 115, 116 and 117th US Congresses. \n",
    "2. **Craft Implicit and Explicit Propositions**: Refer to Appendix 2. of our paper for a description of the instructions used in the paper to craft exemplar poropotitions. We will use the same instructions to craft implicit and explicit propositions for our dataset.\n",
    "3. **Prompt an LLM with the crafted exemplars**: Here, we will use GPT3.5 Turbo for our experiments. \n",
    "4. **Validate**: Confirm that a random sample of the generated decompositions are _plausible_.\n",
    "5. **Downstream Usage**: Use the decompositions in the target task. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, run the first cell below to import the necessary packages and set up the environment. The helper functions and accompanying code are in `eval_mteb.py` and `generation_utils.py`. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note: \n",
    "We assume that your OPENAI_API_KEY is an environment variable. One way to set it is by running - `conda env config vars set OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key_here>` inside your conda environment. It can also be set manually in the config by setting  `config[\"llm\"][\"openai_api_key\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below was tested on a linux server, but should work on other hardware with alterations to pytorch versioning. \\[More additions coming soon!]"
